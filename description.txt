This project is a simple demonstration of using CUDA to accelerate image processing. A CUDA kernel inverts the color of each pixel in a color image (R, G, B values transformed to 255 - value).

### Key Features:
- Pixel-wise GPU parallelism using CUDA
- OpenCV integration for image loading/saving
- Easy-to-run Makefile and CLI interface

### Lessons Learned:
- Working with OpenCV in C++
- Mapping image memory to GPU device pointers
- Launching CUDA kernels and transferring data between host and device

### Future Work:
- Add support for grayscale
- Add other filters (blur, sharpen, etc.)
- Benchmark performance vs CPU-only version
